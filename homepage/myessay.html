        <h1 class = "text-center"><b>The Indian Hub</b></h1>
        <p><div class = "i">New York City is one of the most diverse cities in the world and is inclusive of all cultures. One of those major cultures is Indian culture. The best place to observe true Indian culture in NYC is in Jackson Heights, Queens. However, the best street in Jackson Heights is 74th Street. </div></p>
        <p><div class = "i">From an outsider’s perspective, 74th Street is extremely dirty. As soon as they get to the street, the disgusting stench of the gutter hits their nose, making it impossible to smell the scented rice brought all the way to the nose. Not only that, but there are tons of garbage cans overflowing with cigarettes, receipts, coffee cups, and newspapers. Every two seconds, a bus honks at a car in front of it, and the car driver ignores the honk, causing the bus driver to get angry and honk even more.</div></p>
        <p><div class = "i">However, when you look past the buses, garbage cans, and smells, you can see what 74th street truly represents. It represents a place where an Indian can embrace their culture and find their Indian self, even if they aren’t Indian. While looking at the street, you can see a diversity of shops. There is some part of Indian culture depicted in each and every store, including the Jackson Diner, the ethnic bridal wear stores, the Patel Brothers, the Butala Emporium, and the multitude of stores from which to buy gold jewelry. If I try writing about how much each of the stores on 74th street offer, I will be writing for a very long time because I have found a different part of my identity in each store.</div></p>
        <p><div class = "i">Most Indians in New York are immigrants, so when they come to Jackson Heights, they are astounded by how similar it is to India. No matter what they need, it can be found on 74th street. For example, Butala Emporium is a store that sells literally everything Indian culture-related. It sells religious items, Indian house essentials, henna, bangles, colored sand (for rangolis, sand art), and a variety of other things. Every time my family needs some supplies for a certain puja (a form of worship for Hindus), the perfect place to go to is Butala. These items are always there for any Indian who needs them, which is awesome since they can’t be found anywhere else in NYC, and we don’t have to worry about buying all these products in India in bulk to make sure that we have enough.</div></p>
        <p><div class = "i">As soon as someone walks into the Patel Brothers for the first time, they immediately fall in love with it. All the rich colors of the people, foods, and packets are a part of them. The aromas of the green vegetables and the smell of fresh incense mix to create a remarkable smell of an Indian home. </div></p>
        <p><div class = "i">Indians like sharing this home-type feeling with non-Indians who are just visiting the store for the first time. These people are treated so well, especially by the Patel Brothers staff members. One person would stop restocking and take the time to give the person a tour of the store and would explain the uses of each and every item. All the while, they speak English in their Indian accent, and the other person just nods politely, even though they have no idea what the Indian is saying. However, by the end of the experience, both the Indian and the other person are happy because they either learned new things or taught someone new things, which Indians love to do.</div></p>
        <p><div class = "i"> Indians, NYC is known for Jackson Heights instead of the many other landmarks present. When my uncle and his family visited NYC, we took them everywhere. Of course, they were astounded by the top of the One World Trade Center, the Statue of Liberty, the skyline, the views, and all the other things that tourists hope to see when they come to NYC. However, at the end of their trip, my uncle remembered that he needed to buy sweet-lime pickles. Now, one would wonder why my uncle wants pickles specifically from NYC. The reason is that the pickles of 74th street are extraordinary. Every time I take my uncle to Patel Brothers, he is amazed by the variety of Indian snacks and foods. He always buys so many snacks (more than he can fit in his suitcase, leaving more for me), and every time he calls, he describes how he was licking his fingers after every snack. That’s the good thing about 74th Street, especially since we live in NYC and not India. We never need to worry about not getting food that doesn’t taste homemade because every item is prepackaged with a lot of spice and a little bit of home. </div></p>
